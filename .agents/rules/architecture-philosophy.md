This is an attempt to create a minimal extendable framework for development and research on classification models.

All code in `mini_trainer` should follow the following core principles:

* There should be **NO** additional dependencies beyond core `Python`, `PyTorch` (`torch`, `torchvision`, etc.), `matplotlib` and `tqdm`.
* The required portion of any API should be as minimal as possible (i.e. to train a model we only require `mt_train -i <TRAINING_DATA>`)
* All hyperparameters and system configuration should have smart defaults that are as general as possible
* All functionality should be extendable to custom model architectures, loss functions, training regimes, data formats etc.
